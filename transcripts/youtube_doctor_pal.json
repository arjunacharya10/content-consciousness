  "full_text": "00:00:00\tHello guys! This is Dr Pal! What if I told you that your gut controls almost everything about your health, even your brain? Your mood, your energy, your cravings, and even your risk for diseases like diabetes, autoimmune disorders, and ADHD\u2026 all come down to one thing: your gut bacteria. Sounds crazy, right? But doctors, researchers, and even ancient medicine all point to one undeniable truth: your gut health controls EVERYTHING, not even Illuminati But you know what\u2019s the worst part? Most people have no idea\n\n00:00:30\ttheir gut is damaged until it\u2019s too late. If you\u2019ve ever struggled with bloating, low energy, constant cravings, or even brain fog, chances are, your gut is in trouble. But don\u2019t worry! By the end of this video, you\u2019ll know: The shocking ways your gut controls your body, The dangerous mistakes ruining your gut health, And the exact steps to fix it before it\u2019s too late. So stick with me because this could change your health forever. Let\u2019s start with a simple fact: your gut is home to trillions of bacteria,\n\n00:00:59\tfungi, and viruses together, they make up something called the gut microbiome. Think of it as the Tree of Souls from Avatar, which shelters the blue aliens, but humans destroy it with parotta instead of bazooka Now, you have two types of gut bacteria: Good bacteria they digest food, produce vitamins, and keep your immune system strong. Bad bacteria that cause inflammation, weaken your digestion, and even manipulate your brain.  Yes! The bad gut bacteria can literally manipulate your cravings, and trick your brain\n\n00:01:27\tinto eating more sugar and junk food\u2026 so that they can stay alive. Ever crave chips or sweets out of nowhere? That\u2019s not you. That\u2019s your bad gut bacteria pulling your brain strings. They are literally the honey trap laid by the bad gut bacteria to seduce your brain. Have you ever noticed how stress and anxiety hit your stomach? The reason for that is your gut-brain connection. Your gut and brain are connected through something called the gut-brain axis. This connection is so powerful that your gut\n\n00:01:55\tcan actually influence your thoughts, cravings, and emotions without you realizing it. In fact, scientists have found that the gut constantly sends signals to the brain, like a WhatsApp chat in real time. My friend SK is asking, \u201cIs there a way to make the gut hide information of me eating chat items from the brain?\u201d I said \u201cGut is loyal to brain unlike you, hiding whatsapp chat from tirupurasundari\u201d This matters because your emotional state can affect your stomach and your gut health can impact your mood.\n\n00:02:26\tNot just that but 90% of serotonin, a neurotransmitter which regulates mood, is made in your gut. Also, the bacteria in your gut can affect dopamine levels, which control motivation and focus. Just as Prophet Muhammad is known as the Messenger of God, serotonin can be known as the \u201cmessenger\u201d of the Gut. My friend SK is saying, \u201cThat\u2019s why it is sending signal to ask biryani for Ramzan?\u201d A 2017 study found that poor gut health was directly linked to depression and anxiety. Which means\u2026 If your gut\n\n00:02:58\tis imbalanced, it\u2019s not just your stomach that suffers, it\u2019s your mind too. So if you feel unmotivated, foggy, or low - it\u2019s not just in your head. It could be in your gut. Now, let\u2019s talk about something even more alarming. Your gut bacteria influence chronic diseases like:  Obesity where some bacteria make your body store more fat. Diabetes because a damaged gut causes insulin resistance. And heart diseases as bad gut bacteria increase cholesterol and inflammation. Also scientists have found a direct link\n\n00:03:28\tbetween gut bacteria and memory loss. If a student forgets to write the correct answer in the exam, I suggest the staff to correct the paper with the sentence \u201cImprove your gut bacteria\u201d \u201cImprove your gut bacteria\u201d One study even found that people with poor gut health had a much higher risk of developing autoimmune diseases like arthritis and multiple sclerosis. This is because 70% of your immune system lives in your gut. So, when your gut is healthy, it fights off toxins, viruses, and harmful bacteria.\n\n00:03:54\tBut when it\u2019s damaged, toxins leak into your bloodstream, triggering inflammation and disease. This is called leaky gut syndrome and I\u2019ll talk about it in an upcoming video, I don\u2019t want to leak about it now, so stay tuned! Now, you might be thinking\u2026 \u201cIf my gut controls everything, how did it get damaged in the first place?\u201d Let\u2019s talk about that. Fifty years ago, people had much healthier gut bacteria. But that\u2019s not the case today. Studies show that most of us have lost over 50% of our gut microbiome\n\n00:04:23\tbecause of modern lifestyles. Here\u2019s what\u2019s destroying our gut: Sugar & additives in processed food feed bad bacteria while starving the good ones. While Antibiotics sometimes necessary, they wipe out almost all bacteria. Including the protective ones. Likewise stress levels changes gut bacteria and weakens digestion. Artificial Sweeteners like Aspartame and sucralose have been linked to harmful gut bacteria imbalances. Your good bacteria feed on fiber, so not taking the required amount causes them to starve.\n\n00:04:55\t50% of Gut bacteria has become extinct like the dinosaurs due to the asteroids of chicken nuggets, sugar, and seasoned popcorn hitting the gut. But don\u2019t worry, you CAN repair your gut naturally. And it\u2019s easier than you think. Fixing your gut doesn\u2019t mean taking expensive supplements. In fact, you can start healing  it right now with these simple steps: Number one increase your fiber intake. Eat more vegetables, fruits, nuts, and whole grains. Remember, your good bacteria needs at least 25g of fiber\n\n00:05:24\tper day to survive. Number two eating fermented foods like yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, rice porridge introduce healthy bacteria into your gut. Add this to your matrimony profile, to let them know you are well cultured and the three cut out processed foods and sugar. This starves the bad bacteria and lets the good ones thrive. Number four stay hydrated. Water keeps your gut lining strong and helps with digestion. Number five manage stress meditation. Deep breathing and exercise helps balance gut bacteria.\n\n00:05:56\tAnd number six, eat prebiotic foods like garlic, onions, bananas, and asparagus. All of these feed the gut bacteria. No 7 Try intermittent fasting, especially time restricted feeding of not eating late at night. Studies show fasting boosts gut bacteria diversity and reduces inflammation. Now You don\u2019t need to do ALL of these at once. Just start with one or two, and build from there. I said to my friend Saravana Kumar that he will be in danger if he doesn\u2019t follow these tips, he is saying \u201cI am not in danger da,\n\n00:06:27\t\u201cI am the danger\u201d Now his health is \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d Your gut isn\u2019t just about digestion. It\u2019s the foundation of your entire health. So tell me, which gut-healing step will you start today? Drop a comment below and let me know!
