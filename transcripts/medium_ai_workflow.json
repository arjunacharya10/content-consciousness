Here\u2019s a detailed look at some notable tools, including traditional workflow systems for reference.\n\nComprehensive Customization\nMicrosoft Power Automate\nMicrosoft Power Automate offers the most comprehensive functionality, focusing on product and technical aspects. It connects local laptop RPA with cloud-based DPA, available in the paid version.\n\n\nPower Automate is feature-rich without unnecessary complexities.\n\nDify / FastGPT\nCurrently, Dify provides the best experience among Chinese workflow products. FastGPT\u2019s open-source version offers robust functionality, while Dify\u2019s commercial version requires minimal customization.\n\nProblems Solved:\n\nComplex Logic Construction: Simplifies the creation of applications with complex logic using multi-step workflows.\nStability and Reproducibility: Enhances application stability and reproducibility by allowing precise control over each step\u2019s logic and output.\nIntegration of Complex Business Logic: Facilitates the integration of AI functions with complex business logic without extensive custom coding.\n\nSmythOS\nSmythOS enables the creation of complex sales robots, as illustrated in the flowchart below, featuring global variables like {meeting_recap} and {company_size}.\n\n\nIt supports functions such as web scraping, email sending, and LLM integration, similar to mainstream platforms.\n\n\nCoze\nCurrently, Coze offers basic functionality with poor user experience, possibly due to its free nature.
