00:00:00	I made five thousand dollars in five days from YouTube shorts generated entirely by Ai and in this video I will show you exactly how you can do the same first things first I began by setting up 10 YouTube channels I made sure that the 10 channels covered a number of different niches on YouTube and I made sure that those niches were highly popular and were already getting lots of views this set the stage for the shorts to go viral later on I used chat gbt to come up with the names for the channels

00:00:26	and I used canva templates to design the logos and Banners next it was time to make the shorts and this is where things got interesting my strategy involved posting two shorts per day across 10 different channels that adds up to 140 videos a week now I know that sounds like a lot right but here's the twist I was going to use AI to do every single bit now you might be thinking hang on isn't there a risk of violating YouTube's strict policy against re-uploading others content well my friends that's where I pulled out a very

00:00:55	clever trick but before we get to that let's talk about the fun part first mass producing the YouTube shorts for this I used Opus Clips I then started hunting down viral long-form YouTube videos that already had millions of views with my 10 channels I used podcasts motivational videos and Sports Clips I then copied these long form videos pasted them into the AI tool and then just sat back and watched the magic happen and bang just like that the AI automatically generates dozens of short form videos from a

00:01:23	single long form one the next step was picking and downloading the most promising shorts the ones I felt had a real shot at going viral now you might have seen popular YouTube videos recommending canva for creating shorts but in my experience shorts made this way often don't pull in as many views and can be quite time consuming to create my goal was clear create as many viral shorts in as little time as possible but there is one very big problem YouTube will not allow channels to monetize these videos but this is

00:01:50	where I used a very clever trick to pass YouTube's originality check I made sure to give each one a unique twist and in the end I found two editing methods that worked best first up compilations all I did was use an AI video editor such as in video to Simply combine together multiple different shorts that Opus Clips had previously created for us the result dozens of compilation videos all ready for monetization on YouTube from my experience these videos also possess the highest likelihood of going viral my

00:02:18	second method was what I call a mix and match again I used in video for this popped in the shorts and replaced certain segments with stock videos just by adding a new stock video every few seconds YouTube was completely okay with monetizing here's an example of a channel doing exactly that and earns over two hundred thousand dollars in monthly Revenue so armed with 10 AI crafted YouTube channels and a big collection of original shorts videos it was time for the Finishing Touch crafting catchy titles and posting on

00:02:47	each Channel twice a day YouTube is pushing shorts more than ever before and with the high quality output of AI scoring views really is easier than ever what's even better is that all 10 channels gained tons of subscribers with some even gaining thousands should you wish to start uploading long form content for higher RPM you'll have 10 ready to go channels all established on the solid foundation of YouTube shorts but the story doesn't end there these channels turned out to be a gold mine for affiliate marketing the easiest

00:03:16	method I found was to use a platform like ClickBank simply search for products closely related to your shorts and paste the link in the comments if you followed all steps so far you'll have shorts racking up millions of views opening up a massive opportunity for you to make big money from those affiliate links remember the key to success is consistency imagine the growth of all 10 channels after a year your YouTube shorts could regularly be getting millions of views and each Channel alone could earn you tens or even hundreds of

00:03:45	thousands per month now guys if you enjoyed this video I recommend you watch our latest video 30 genius strategies to make money using Ai and chat gbt this YouTube shorts method is just one of those 30 so make sure you check out the others
