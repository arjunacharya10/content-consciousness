This easy, step-by-step fresh pasta recipe and video will teach you how to make soft, silky homemade pasta in about 1 hour (with or without a machine). Fresh pasta is one of life‚Äôs greatest pleasures: use this versatile dough to make fettuccini, homemade lasagna noodles, ravioli, pappardelle pasta and more.

Fresh homemade pasta: Too hard? Too time consuming? Most people think so, just like making sourdough bread.

But really, fresh pasta is all about the dough. Master the texture (soft and smooth, not dry or crumbly!) and the rest is easy. The art and craft will captivate you. This was my pandemic activity.

What To Expect.
You‚Äôll learn how to make the classic fresh pasta recipe with flour and eggs. You can make it by hand, with a KitchenAid stand mixer, or a food processor- your choice. I‚Äôll also share my go-to tips for storing, freezing, and cooking so your pasta turns out perfect every time.

Why This Fresh Pasta Recipe Works:
Fine-milled Italian Tipo 00 flour and eggs create a soft, supple dough that‚Äôs easy to knead by hand (61% hydration).
A mix of whole eggs and yolk adds rich flavor and golden color.
This pasta dough works for lasagna noodles, homemade ravioli, pappardelle pasta and more.

Emilie‚Äôs Fresh Pasta Tips:
Make space. You‚Äôll need a long, clutter-free surface to roll the dough. Pasta sheets can measure up to 3 ft long! Kitchen table is ideal.
Weigh your ingredients (including the eggs). This gets the pasta dough texture right: soft and pliable. Too little egg? You‚Äôll get dry and crumbly dough. Use a digital scale for accuracy. Skip the measuring cups.
Wrap it up. Pasta dough dries out fast. It can also oxidize. Keep it wrapped or covered with an upturned bowl at all times.
Fresh pasta ingredients: Brown eggs in a carton and italian Tipo 00 flour
Ingredients & Equipment You Will Need:
Italian Tipo 00 flour: this fine milled, soft wheat Italian flour creates light, tender pasta. The texture feels like baby powder! I like Molino Grassi or Caputo. Substitute with King Arthur all purpose flour for similar results.
Large eggs + yolk: adds moisture, color, and flavor to the dough. Size matters. I use large eggs (~55‚Äì58g each).
Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer (w/ pasta attachments): Mix, knead, roll, and cut all in one convenient machine.
Manual Pasta Machine: Roll and cut dough by hand (non-electric).

How To Make Fresh Pasta {Step-by-Step Recipe}
Below, you‚Äôll find easy instructions to make the dough by hand. I use a stand mixer with pasta attachments to roll and cut the pasta. You‚Äôll have enough to feed 4 people, with storage tips and delicious pasta sauce pairing ideas. For a detailed, printable recipe: scroll to the end.

Step #1: Make Pasta Dough
Mound the flour onto a board; make a well in the center. Crack in the eggs. Beat the eggs with a fork, then gradually incorporate the flour until the dough comes together. Finish by hand to form a rough dough. If bits of flour remain (be patient, it‚Äôs a dry dough), add a few drops of water or olive oil to help it along.
Cover and rest for 10 minutes. This step is often skipped in most recipes, but it‚Äôs essential. Coming from my bread baker‚Äôs perspective: the dough needs time to hydrate before kneading. It will be softer and easier to handle.
Now, knead the dough for 5-7 minutes using the heel of your hand (watch the video). It‚Äôll start out stiff and dense, but soften as you go. The goal? A smooth, supple dough that gently springs back when poked.
Shape it into a ball, wrap tightly, and let it rest again for 30 minutes at room temperature.
Want to speed things up? You can make the dough in a food processor or stand mixer. See the recipe card at the end of this post for detailed instructions.

Step #2: Roll Fresh Pasta Sheets
Dust your work surface, sheet pan, and pasta machine with semolina flour.
Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces and keep the extras covered. Flatten one piece into an oval disc.
Send it through the roller on the lowest/widest setting (#1 on the Kitchen Aid attachment). Now, send it through again for a smoother finish.
Continue rolling it through settings #2-4 (2x on each setting) for fettuccine, pappardelle and tagliatelle. Go up to #5 if you‚Äôre making ravioli. The pasta sheet is ready when it‚Äôs slightly translucent and you can see your hand underneath.
Fold the finished pasta sheet in half, lay it on your sheet pan, and cover. Repeat with the remaining dough.
Tip: Why Semolina Flour? It absorbs less moisture than regular flour and helps to prevent sticking. Rice flour works too. My surface is always covered in a blanket of semolina flour while I work!

Step #3: Cut Sheets Into Pasta
Before cutting: I like to semi-dry the pasta sheets for 5‚Äì15 minutes by hanging them over a chair, rod or on a hanger. This gives the strands a leathery feel (not too soft or doughy) and helps to prevent the pasta strands from sticking together later on.
Take a pasta sheet and cut in half. Send it through the cutter attachment. Dust the strands well with semolina, then form into nests or lay flat on a tray. Repeat the cutting process for the remaining pasta sheets.

How to Store, Freeze & Cook Fresh Pasta
To store: Keep well-floured pasta on a tray, covered with plastic wrap, inverted sheet pan or in an airtight container. Leave at room temperature if cooking within 1‚Äì2 hours, or refrigerate for up to 12.
I recommend cooking it the same day to avoid discoloration or sticking, if chilled past 24 hrs.

To freeze: Let pasta air-dry (uncovered) for 15‚Äì20 minutes first to prevent sticking. Then portion into zip-top bags and freeze for up to 1 month. Cook straight from frozen; no need to defrost.

To cook: Add pasta to generously salted boiling water.
Cook time ranges from 2‚Äì7 minutes depending on thickness and shape. Taste as you go. It should be al dente (soft but with a bite). Use tongs to lift the pasta directly into your sauce.

Description
This easy, step-by-step fresh pasta recipe will teach you how to make soft, silky homemade pasta in 1 hour (with or without a machine). It‚Äôs an all purpose pasta dough: use it to make homemade fettuccine, pappardelle, homemade ravioli and more. 

For timing, the process is broken up into 3 parts: making the dough, rolling the dough into pasta sheets, and cutting the pasta into noodles. Tips shared below for using a Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer, food processor and doing it by hand.

Ingredients
300 g Italian Tipo 00 Flour  (I recommend Molino Grassi or Caputo)
3 large eggs (see note below)
1 large egg yolk
Semolina flour, for dusting (rice flour can be used)
*Note: the total combined weight for the eggs & yolk (cracked) should be 185 g. Because eggs size will vary, make up the difference, if needed, with an extra egg yolk or olive oil. Olive oil makes the dough more soft, supple and satisfying to work with. 

Pasta Equipment (choose one)
Kitchen Aid Stand Mixer (w/ pasta attachments)
Pasta Machine
Tips:
Make space. You‚Äôll need a long, clutter-free work surface to handle the dough. The kitchen table or kitchen island is perfect.
Weigh your ingredients (including the eggs). This will ensure the correct texture of the dough. If your eggs are too small, the dough will be dry and crumbly.
Wrap it up. Pasta dough can dry out quickly. Keep it covered with wrap or a kitchen towel.

Instructions
Step #1: Make The Dough
The Traditional Way (by hand):

Add the flour to a large bowl. Make a well in the center; add the eggs and yolk.
Whisk together with a fork, and then combine with the flour. When the texture becomes stiff, finish by hand to form a rough dough. If dry bits of flour remain after a few minutes of mixing (be patient, it‚Äôs a dry dough) add a few drops of water or olive oil to bring the dough together. 
Form the dough into a ball, cover with an upturned bowl or with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 10-15 minutes- it will be easier to knead.
Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes. Do this by folding the dough over itself, pushing it forward with the heel of your hand, turning slightly as you go. I literally rock the dough back and forth (watch the video). The texture will be very stiff at first- it‚Äôs not bread dough. But rest assured, by the 2 minute mark it will start to soften. Keep kneading until the dough is soft, malleable and has a talcum-like finish. It should ‚Äúbounce back‚Äù slowly when poked.
Form the dough into a ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
Stand Mixer Instructions:

Fit the machine with the dough hook. Add the flour and eggs to the bowl. Mix until combined. Knead on speed #1 or #2, about 4-5 minutes. Form the dough into a ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Food Processor Instructions:

Add the flour and eggs to the bowl. Pulse several times until the dough comes together. Remove the dough to your work surface and let rest for 1 minute. If the dough is a bit sticky after resting, add a sprinkle of flour. Knead by hand for 1-2 minutes (the food processor does most of the kneading for you). Form the dough into a ball, cover tightly with plastic wrap, and rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.

Step #2: Roll The Dough Into Pasta Sheets
Set up your station: Dust your work surface with semolina flour. Dust a sheet pan with semolina flour (your pasta sheets will land here). Fit the stand mixer with the roller attachment. Grab a kitchen towel. You‚Äôre ready to roll.

On your work surface, cut the pasta dough into 4 pieces. Working with one piece at a time, flatten the dough into a 6-8inch oval patty. Keep the remaining doughs covered in wrap otherwise they will dry out. 
Set the pasta roller to #1 which is the lowest/widest setting on the Kitchen Aid. With the machine running, send the dough through the roller. Now, send it through again (so, 2x total). Note: if you are using a hand crank pasta machine, refer to the manufacture‚Äôs specific instructions for rolling the dough- the settings might differ but the process is the same.
Continue to roll the dough through settings #2-4, (2x) on each setting. Do not pull on the sheet as it comes through the roller; just guide it along gently. If at any point the dough becomes sticky, dust with semolina flour. I keep my work surface dusted with semolina at all times. This way I can coat both sides of my pasta sheet easily and quickly while I work.
Your pasta sheet is ready when it‚Äôs beautifully thin and somewhat translucent (you should be able to see your hand underneath). Don‚Äôt worry if the ends are not perfectly straight; you can always trim them with a knife.
To finish, dust the pasta sheet generously with semolina, fold it in half, and place onto your floured sheet pan. Cover with a kitchen towel. Repeat the rolling process for the remaining 3 doughs.
Step #3: Cut The Pasta 
Before cutting, I like to dry my pasta sheets ever so slightly. This firms up the final texture giving the strands a more ‚Äúleathery‚Äù finish, rather than a soft and doughy feel (this will prevent the pasta from sticking together later on). 
To Dry: Hang the pasta sheets over the back of a chair for about 10-15 minutes or so. Keep your eye on the time; you don‚Äôt want the sheets to dry out completely. You will be able to feel the difference.
To Cut: take a pasta sheet and cut it in half. Trim the ends, if you like. Run the sheet through your desired pasta cutter attachment to create strands. Alternatively, cut the dough by hand.
To Store: Heavily dust the pasta strands with flour. Coil around your hand or arrange loosely on a tray. Cover with plastic wrap and hold at room temperature if cooking within 1-2 hours. Alternatively, store in the fridge for up to 12 hrs. checking occasionally, to make sure the strands are not sticking. Note: Pasta left in the fridge past 24 hrs might oxidize, discolor and/or stick together.

To Freeze: Allow the pasta to air-dry, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes before freezing. The helps to prevent sticking. Portion into ziptop bags, remove the air, and freeze, up to 1 month. Cook directly from frozen, no need to defrost first.
