The Current Landscape of AI Workflow Automation Tools
In the current landscape, AI workflow automation tools are still maturing. They offer various customization features and plugins suitable for simple applications like creating social media content and generating images.

Key Features:

Support for custom plugins and large language models (LLM) to varying degrees.
Ability to set up workflows, similar to Robotic Process Automation (RPA) processes.
Availability of workflow templates, store templates, and plugin templates.
Among the available tools, some focus on comprehensive customization, while others are tailored for team collaboration. Here‚Äôs a detailed look at some notable tools, including traditional workflow systems for reference.

Comprehensive Customization
Microsoft Power Automate
Microsoft Power Automate offers the most comprehensive functionality, focusing on product and technical aspects. It connects local laptop RPA with cloud-based DPA, available in the paid version.


Power Automate is feature-rich without unnecessary complexities.

Dify / FastGPT
Currently, Dify provides the best experience among Chinese workflow products. FastGPT‚Äôs open-source version offers robust functionality, while Dify‚Äôs commercial version requires minimal customization.

Problems Solved:

Complex Logic Construction: Simplifies the creation of applications with complex logic using multi-step workflows.
Stability and Reproducibility: Enhances application stability and reproducibility by allowing precise control over each step‚Äôs logic and output.
Integration of Complex Business Logic: Facilitates the integration of AI functions with complex business logic without extensive custom coding.

SmythOS
SmythOS enables the creation of complex sales robots, as illustrated in the flowchart below, featuring global variables like {meeting_recap} and {company_size}.


It supports functions such as web scraping, email sending, and LLM integration, similar to mainstream platforms.


Coze
Currently, Coze offers basic functionality with poor user experience, possibly due to its free nature. Awaiting updates for significant improvements, especially in model upgrades and practical plugin implementation.

MindStudio
MindStudio supports custom LLMs, knowledge bases, and multiple plugins. It allows API generation for other platforms and usage tracking.


Templates Available:

Analyzing emotions from CSV files.
AI resume analysis.
Advertising and marketing creativity assistance.
Users can customize workflows or input goals for AI-generated workflows.



MindStudio‚Äôs LLMs are usage-based, with a $5 free credit for new users.


Yingdao & Zapier
Transitioning from traditional RPA, Yingdao is adding AI applications, similar to Zapier‚Äôs integration with AI tools like ChatGPT and HeyGen.


With numerous mature plugins for domestic e-commerce and social platforms, Yingdao is more practical than many listed workflow products.


Zapier also includes AI functionalities such as video generation with HeyGen.

Some tools appear to offer limited functionality and are listed for reference.

Scriptit
Supports custom text and APIs with an AI conversation interface.

Currently supports a few plugins, primarily image-related, with simple customization options.

Office Scenarios
QuestFlow
Ranked 4th on Product Hunt, QuestFlow focuses on team collaboration workflows like email sending, meeting summaries, social media posting, and news collection.


QuestFlow offers limited templates, primarily for news collection, email translation, email collection, writing, and content generation.


QuestFlow has specific industry scenarios and commercial pricing at $8 per month for 250 automation executions.


Similar products for team workflows include Make and Nanonets, without AI models like Perplexity and GPT.
